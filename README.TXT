Here's my solution for the test. Done with Bash -scripting. I took the liberty to assume that the main point of the test was to assess the logical skills more than pure developing skills in e.g. java etc.
I did choose bash -scripting because that's what I've been using lately, the other script/programming languages would've required a bit more work to get in and I did not have time for that.

The structure of the programs/scripts is as follows:

- RUN_THIS: 	The main script which calls the other scripts
	- Zero:		The Fibonacci sequence
	- One: 		The Fibonacci sequence recursively
	- Two: 		Palindrome
	- Three:	Randomness
	- INFO:		Echoes THIS TEXT
